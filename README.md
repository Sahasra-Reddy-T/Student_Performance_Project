<h1 align="center">🎓 Student Performance Prediction</h1> <h2 align="center">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project</h2>
<br>
💡 Overview
<br>
This project, Student Performance Prediction, focuses on analyzing and understanding how various factors affect students’ academic outcomes.
<br>
The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset to uncover insights about students’ performance in math, reading, and writing scores.
<br>
Through data visualization and interpretation, this project highlights how gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation influence overall academic achievement.
<br>
The notebook — Student_Performance_Prediction.ipynb — is a beginner-friendly Python project aimed at building strong foundations in data exploration, visualization, and interpretation.
<br><br>
🧠 Objectives
<br>
To explore relationships between student demographics and exam performance.
<br>
To visualize data distributions and variations across different groups.
<br>
To identify factors (like lunch type or test preparation) that significantly affect student outcomes.
<br>
To gain hands-on experience in data cleaning, EDA, and visual storytelling using Python.
<br><br>
📂 Dataset Information
<br>
Dataset used: StudentsPerformance.csv
<br>
Features include:
<br>
gender — Gender of the student.
<br>
race/ethnicity — Group classification based on background.
<br>
parental level of education — Education level of the student’s parents.
<br>
lunch — Type of lunch received (standard or free/reduced).
<br>
test preparation course — Whether the student completed a test prep course.
<br>
math score, reading score, writing score — Scores achieved by the student in each subject.
<br><br>
⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
<br>
Python 🐍
<br>
pandas – For data manipulation and preprocessing.
<br>
numpy – For numerical operations and calculations.
<br>
matplotlib & seaborn – For data visualization.
<br>
Jupyter Notebook – For integrating code, analysis, and visualization in one workflow.
<br><br>
📊 Key Steps in the Project
<br>
🔹 Step 1: Data Loading & Understanding
Loaded the dataset using pandas and reviewed its structure, column names, and data types.
<br>
🔹 Step 2: Data Cleaning
Checked for missing values and inconsistencies to ensure accurate analysis.
<br>
🔹 Step 3: Feature Exploration
Explored all categorical variables — gender, lunch type, parental education, etc.
<br>
🔹 Step 4: Visualization
Analyzed score distributions using histograms and boxplots.
<br>
Used countplots and bar graphs to compare performance across groups.
<br>
Created a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between math, reading, and writing scores.
<br>
🔹 Step 5: Insights Extraction
Derived patterns and summarized key findings from the visualizations.
<br><br>
📈 Key Insights
<br>
📍 Students with standard lunch consistently performed better across all subjects.
<br>
📍 Those who completed test preparation courses achieved higher average scores.
<br>
📍 Parents’ higher education levels strongly correlate with student performance.
<br>
📍 Female students excelled in reading and writing, while male students performed slightly better in math.
<br><br>
